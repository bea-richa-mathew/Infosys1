Sample Flow of the Project

1. twitter_client.py → Extracts tweets from Twitter API and saves them into extracted_tweets.json.


2. sentiment_analysis.py → Analyzes the tweets using Gemini API for sentiment, engagement, keywords, and audience, then stores results in analyzed_tweets.json.


3. run_prompt.py → Prepares the system prompt using the analyzed tweets and defines the output structure.


4. create_tweet.py → Generates a new engaging tweet, predicts performance, and explains why it will perform well compared to the example tweets.



➡️ End-to-End Run:
twitter_client.py → sentiment_analysis.py → run_prompt.py → create_tweet.py
